    /**
     * Processes a method invocation on a proxy instance and returns the result.
     * This method will be invoked on an invocation handler when a method is
     * invoked on a proxy instance that it is associated with.
     *

     *            the proxy instance that the method was invoked on
     * @param method
     *            the Method instance corresponding to the interface method
     *            invoked on the proxy instance. The declaring class of the
     *            Method object will be the interface that the method was
     *            declared in, which may be a superinterface of the proxy
     *            interface that the proxy class inherits the method through.
     * @param args
     *            an array of objects containing the values of the arguments
     *            passed in the method invocation on the proxy instance, or null
     *            if interface method takes no arguments. Arguments of primitive
     *            types are wrapped in instances of the appropriate primitive
     *            wrapper class, such as java.lang.Integer or java.lang.Boolean.
     * @return the value to return from the method invocation on the proxy
     *         instance. If the declared return type of the interface method is
     *         a primitive type, then the value returned by this method must be
     *         an instance of the corresponding primitive wrapper class;
     *         otherwise, it must be a type assignable to the declared return
     *         type. If the value returned by this method is null and the
     *         interface method's return type is primitive, then a
     *         NullPointerException will be thrown by the method invocation on
     *         the proxy instance. If the value returned by this method is
     *         otherwise not compatible with the interface method's declared
     *         return type as described above, a ClassCastException will be
     *         thrown by the method invocation on the proxy instance.
     * @throws Throwable
     *             the exception to throw from the method invocation on the
     *             proxy instance. The exception's type must be assignable
     *             either to any of the exception types declared in the throws
     *             clause of the interface method or to the unchecked exception
     *             types java.lang.RuntimeException or java.lang.Error. If a
     *             checked exception is thrown by this method that is not
     *             assignable to any of the exception types declared in the
     *             throws clause of the interface method, then an
     *             UndeclaredThrowableException containing the exception that
     *             was thrown by this method will be thrown by the method
     *             invocation on the proxy instance.
