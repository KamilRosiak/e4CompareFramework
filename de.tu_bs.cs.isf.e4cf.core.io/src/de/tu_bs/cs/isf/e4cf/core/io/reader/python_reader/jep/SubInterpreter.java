/**
 * Class for creating instances of Interpreters which are sandboxed from other
 * Interpreters. Sub-interpreters isolate different SubInterpreter instances,
 * allowing them to be used safely from multiple unrelated pieces of a Java
 * application without any risk that the SubInterpreters will impact each other.
 * An exception to this is when a SubIntepreter uses CPython extensions, there
 * is no guarantee that other Interpreters may not be affected. The level of
 * isolation depends on if the CPython extension was written to support multiple
 * interpreters in the same process. In those cases you may want to consider
 * using the shared modules feature or a SharedInterpreter.
 *
 * Within a single Java process it is valid to mix Interpreter instances that
 * use SubInterpreters with SharedInterpreters. The SubInterpreter instances
 * will remain isolated from other SubInterpreters and from any
 * SharedInterpreters. To maintain stability, it is not possible to have
 * multiple Interpreter instances active on the same Thread at the same time and
 * this limitation includes SubInterpreters.
