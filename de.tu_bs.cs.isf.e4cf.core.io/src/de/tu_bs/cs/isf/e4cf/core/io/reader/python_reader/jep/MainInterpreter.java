/**
 * The main Python interpreter that all sub-interpreters will be created from.
 * In a simpler embedded Python project, a single Python interpreter would be
 * used and all would be good. However, since Jep supports multithreading with
 * multiple sub-interpreters, we need the MainInterpreter to work around some
 * issues.
 * 
 * The MainInterpreter is used to avoid potential deadlocks. Python can deadlock
 * when trying to acquire the GIL through methods such as <a href=
 * "https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#c.PyGILState_Ensure">PyGILState_*</a>.
 * While Jep does not use those methods, CPython extensions such as numpy do.
 * The deadlock can occur if there is more than one PyThreadState per thread. To
 * get around this, the MainInterpreter creates a unique thread that initializes
 * Python and keeps this thread around forever. This ensures that any new
 * sub-interpreters cannot be created on the same thread as the main Python
 * interpreter.
 * 
 * The MainInterpreter is also used to support shared modules. While each
 * sub-interpreter is fairly sandboxed, in practice this does not always work
 * well with CPython extensions. In particular, disposing of a sub-interpreter
 * that has imported a CPython extension may cause some of the CPython
 * extension's objects to be garbage collected. To get around this, shared
 * modules import on the main interpreter's thread so they can be shared amongst
 * sub-interpreters and will never be garbage collected.
 * 
 * For more information about why the MainInterpreter class exists, see <a href=
 * "https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#bugs-and-caveats">Sub-interpreter
 * bugs and caveats</a>.
