/**
 * Class for creating instances of Interpreters which share all imported
 * modules. In this case each SharedInterpreter still maintains distinct global
 * variables but some interpreter state will be shared. This is equivalent to
 * using shared modules to share every Python package in Jep. Anything that
 * changes the way a module behaves will impact all SharedInterpreters so care
 * must be taken to ensure that different SharedInterpreters aren't conflicting.
 * For example sys.path, time.tzset(), and numpy.seterr() will change the
 * behavior of all SharedInterpreters.
 *
 * Within a single Java process it is valid to mix Interpreter instances that
 * use SubInterpreters with SharedInterpreters. The SubInterpreter instances
 * will remain isolated from SubInterpreter instances and from any
 * SharedInterpreters. To maintain stability, it is not possible to have
 * multiple Interpreter instances active on the same Thread at the same time and
 * this limitation includes SharedInterpreters.
