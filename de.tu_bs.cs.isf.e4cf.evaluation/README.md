# Generating Clones and Evaluating Clone Detection Tools

## Rough Plan
- [X] Super Simple Base Example
- [X] Transform into Generic Data Structure
- <Entry Point for Project 1>
- [X] Take a look at how to modify data structure (semantic)
- [X] How to create clones? -> Paper Taxonomy
- [X] Log Modifications to Trees -> OG Location, Clone Location (File:Line), Operations (Taxonomy)
- [X] How to save Tree
- [ ] How to determine nodes to clone
- ...
- [ ] Determine Exchange Data Format [4Weeks] (FileSet<GenericDataStructures>, ..?)
  - Metadata as Log?
- <Entry Point for Project 2>
- ...


Seeds als Base-File
Repository of Cloneable Code
Empty nodes are great targets for duplication.
Nodes with Attributes are great candidates for cloning but respect their containment.
Xtend ok.
